# 40-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know

## Overview

* Implementation of some algorithms from this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Every-Programmer-Should-Know/dp/1789801214) as a personal challenge

## Features
* The implementation of the algorithms are in only academic purpose
* The base programming language used is [C++](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") (although algorithms in the book are implemented in [Python](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python)) 
* The C++ standard used was [C++14](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14 "C++14")
